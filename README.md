OPEN URLS IN TABS
=================

A Python modification of John Gruber's (Daring Fireball) [Open URLs in Safari Tabs](http://daringfireball.net/2010/08/open_urls_in_safari_tabs).

Uses the webbrowser module to open the URLs in the system default browser (e.g.
Chrome) rather than Safari. 

Distributed as an [OSX service](http://www.macosxautomation.com/services/index.html), like the original.
